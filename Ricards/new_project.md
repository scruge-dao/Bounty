## Bounty Agreement serves to create a blockchain service in which people are rewarded with tokens for doing useful work

The intent of the {{newproject}} action is to register a project {{providerName}} that can list bounty campaigns for other people to complete

I,{{providerName}}, promise in good faith that:

1. I will not create Bounties that promote illegal, violent, racist or any discriminatory behaviour.
2. I will not engage in deceptive behaviour and will at all times judge in good faith the efforts of Bounty Hunters and make fair payouts based on the Rewards description that I provide.
3. I will not discriminate against Bounty Hunters on their characteristics.
4. I will not engage in deceptive practices to impersonate any other project that I, {{providername}}, is not representing.


I understand that the creator of this contract bears no responsibility over my actions. Should my actions deemed to be illegal in any jurisdiction, I take full responsibility over my actions.
